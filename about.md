        <p><strong>Creative Strategist | Ads, Ideas & Mild Existential Crises</strong></p>
        
        <p>I think, rethink and overthink ideas until they become award-worthy (or at least scroll-stopping). Whether it's a snappy tagline, a full-blown campaign, or a strategy to make a brand unforgettable, I love turning briefs into stories people actually want to watch.</p>
        
        <p>Not much to write, but I've got the thinking cap on 24/7, turning ideas into something worth talking about, and I can wordsmith with the best of them. Teamwork? Love it. Strategy? Even better. And yes, I make a mean pun when needed.</p>
